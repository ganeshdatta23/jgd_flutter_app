# jgd_flutter_app

I'm having trouble creating the Flutter project automatically. It seems the `flutter` command is not working in the environment I have access to.

Could you please help me by creating the project yourself?

Please run the following command in your terminal, in the `D:\jgd\jgd_flutter_app` directory:

```
flutter create . --project-name sri_guru_dig_vandanam --org com.example
```

Once the project is created, I can continue with building the app features. Just let me know when you're ready!
